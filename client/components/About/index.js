        <h3>OUR PRODUCT</h3>
        <p>It’s simple. No searching. Just two Sizes. No frames.</p>
        <p>
          We want to make buying awesome, affordable, ready-to-hang photos as simple and easy as
          possible for you. That’s why on our Qurate page you can take our preference test, and our
          algorithm will suggest the best photos from our exclusive collection that best meet your
          style. Simply click the photos you like best, choose a size (of two), and your all set!
          Once you check out, your pieces will be printed and shipped directly to you, ready to
          hang upon arrival. We think that our beautiful canvas boards are a much more elegant
          hanging solution than bulky frames, and we think you’ll agree!

        <h3>OUR ARTISTS</h3>
        <p>
          Our photos come from some of the most talented up and coming photographers out there.
          Your purchases help support independent artists who are passionate about their work and
          are not yet commercialized. Even more, our site is typically the only online platform
          where you can purchase prints of their photos!

        <h3>OUR TEAM</h3>
        <p>
          As a group of busy young professionals, we all prioritized having an attractive living
          space for entertaining. We wanted to have pieces of art on our walls that expressed who
          we were and fit with our décor, but we did not all understand the intricacies of art or
          have the time to source art from galleries. During our second semester at Harvard
          Business School, we decided to start Qurator, a service for those who want art, but
          don’t know where to start.</p>
        <p>
          When interviewing consumers in our target young professional segment, we found that
          most people we talked to were intimidated by art because they did not understand it
          and were unable to identify their art preferences. We also heard many complaints about
          the high cost of art and the difficulties involved with the framing process.
          At Qurator we have designed an easy-to-use algorithm where the customer clicks
          through pieces of art, picking their favorites and is then recommended a small subset
          of pieces for purchase. These pieces are priced affordably and are delivered to the
          customer’s residence in a ready-to-hang format.</p>
        <p>
          We hope your enjoy our website and tell your friends about us. We’d also love to hear
          from you, so contact us with any feedback.</p>
        <p>Happy shopping!</p>
